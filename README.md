# Assorted-Projects
## Summary
An assortment of random projects for the sake of tinkering with features and sematics of languages, concepts of programming, and any other random projects and excersies that I do. The majority of the contents of this repo will be small and unpolished projects that really don't make sense to have their own repo.

## C-Projects
A folder which as the name implies contains a collection of C projects.

### Basics
The basics section is intended to be written in a way that a new user of C can understand the steps and follow along. This hopefully, can be used by new C developers to learn the language and serve as a strong reminder to myself of the basics.

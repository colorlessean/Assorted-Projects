# Recipe App
Web application for recipes that I have to be stored and recalled at a latter date.
Will have the ability to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipies from the webiste.
Dynamically create shopping lists from a collection of recipies chosen.
Should be able to scale portion sizes as well.
Recipies will be an evolving object that has many different attributes.
Starting as a simple web-form application to just take in recipe data.
